# **App Name**: Property Tycoon Lite

## Core Features:

- Game Creation: Create a new game session and share a link or ID for others to join.
- Game Joining: Join an existing game session using a provided link or ID.
- Board Visualization: Display the game board, player positions, and available properties.
- Player Status: Show player balances, owned properties, and current status (e.g., in jail).
- Auctioning: Initiate auctions for unowned properties. Manage bidding UI for each player. If an auction becomes contentious, use an AI tool to manage and arbitrate the auction according to fair rules and bid validation. The AI will ensure each bid is a valid increase over the last.

- Trading: Implement basic trade functionality allowing players to propose and complete trades. Each player sees which properties are available for trading. Allow transfer of cash between players as well.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #388E3C (RGB), a saturated green reminiscent of money and growth.
- Background color: #E8F5E9 (RGB), a light green to create a calm and inviting play space.
- Accent color: #F9A825 (RGB), a bright yellow, analogous to green, is used to highlight important calls to action and game elements like the dice roll button or current player turn.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines to give the app a traditional and sophisticated feel, paired with 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure readability.
- Use simple, recognizable icons for properties, actions (e.g., 'Buy', 'Trade'), and player status (e.g., 'In Jail').
- A clean, tiled layout for the game board, focusing on property visualization. Clear separation of player status panels from the main board.
- Use subtle animations for dice rolls and property transitions to give clear visual feedback.
